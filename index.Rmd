### Date

Winter 2022

### Abstract

In this project, we question the relationship(s) between global healthcare systems and healthcare expenditure. Understanding this is important because it allows us to find the best way to finance healthcare and optimize its delivery across the world. To answer this question, we plan on analyzing data from the World Bank, taking into consideration the limitations and biases present in the dataset.
